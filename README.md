# rpgPromoBot
A Python bot used for making "promotion" posts on a tumblr rpg's promo blog. Allows user to mass queue promo posts instead of manually copy/pasting the post content several times.


## How to do the thing
If you already have python/pip/pytumblr installed, skip steps **1** through **3!**

**1.** Make sure you have Python 3 or higher (https://www.python.org/). 

**2.** Ensure your pip/setup tools are up to date. Open your command line (cmd.exe) and input the following: 

>Windows: `python -m pip install -U pip setuptools` 

>Linux/Mac: `pip install -U pip setuptools`

**3.** Still in the command line, input `pip install pytumblr`


**At this point, you are ready to start playing with rpgPromoBot!**


**4.** Download this repository, in your own folder for your RPG/It's promo blog. Be sure to have a unique copy of this for each RPG, it makes things easier.

**5.** When you want to run the program to queue posts, run *Main.py.* To set this thing up for your own rpg, you're going to want to edit *PostArchive.py.* This is where all of your "templates" will go for your posts. More details on this are in *PostArchive.py* itself.
